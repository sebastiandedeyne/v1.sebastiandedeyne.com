      <em><strong>Growing the Stack</strong></em> is a biweekly—as in, once
      every two weeks—newsletter about programming, design, and other related
      topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newsletter isn't tied to any programming language or ecosystem, and
      it's not meant keep you up to date with all the new & shiny tools out
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It tries to bundle content that <em>inspires</em>. Content that triggers
      you to think about new concepts which might help you solve your next big
      project's problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quantity over quality. Editions will be sent <strong>every two weeks
      </strong> on Tuesday. Each will contain <strong>three links</strong> about
      programming, design, the web, the workplace, ethics, productivity, or
      any other relatable subject.
