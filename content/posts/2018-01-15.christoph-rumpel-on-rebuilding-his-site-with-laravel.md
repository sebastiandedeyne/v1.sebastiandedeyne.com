[Christoph Rumpel](https://christoph-rumpel.com) published his revamped site last week, built with Laravel and Tailwind CSS. He based the site's architecture on my personal site (yeah, the one you're reading now). I [open sourced it](https://github.com/sebastiandedeyne/sebastiandedeyne.com) about a year ago, and I'm glad to see that it provided value to someone!
