title: Diving into requestAnimationFrame with Benjamin De Cock
---
I love this post! `requestAnimationFrame` is a primitive browser API that doesn’t sound too interesting at first, but once you've grasped some basic concepts, it becomes an extremely powerful tool for dealing with animations in JavaScript.

> At its core, `requestAnimationFrame` doesn’t do much: it’s basically just a method that executes a callback. In fact, there are very few differences between doing `requestAnimationFrame(doSomething)` and `doSomething()`. So, what’s so special about it? I’m glad you asked! In short:

> - `requestAnimationFrame` passes the callback the current time

My favorite part: since a large part of animating with `requestAnimationFrame` consists of composing small mathematical expressions, you can apply all sorts of functional programming tricks to your code.
