title: Introducing our company guidelines site
---
We just open sourced [our company guidelines site](https://guidelines.spatie.be)! We previously kept the contents in a private wiki on GitHub, but I'm glad we finally put the time in giving the contents a real home.

Like [our docs site](https://github.com/spatie/docs.spatie.be), the content is stored in markdown files, which can directly be edited [on GitHub](https://github.com/spatie/guidelines.spatie.be). The site deploys whenever something's pushed to the master branch.

As for why we decided to open source it all...

> This site contains a set of guidelines we use to bring our projects to a good end. We decided to document our workflow because consistency is one of the most valuable traits of maintainable software.
>
> The contents of this site exist for ourselves—more importantly, our future selves—and for giving future collegues a reference to our way of doing things and their quirks. The guidelines cover workflow, code style, and other little things we consider worth documenting.

The guidelines are available on [guidelines.spatie.be](https://guidelines.spatie.be).
