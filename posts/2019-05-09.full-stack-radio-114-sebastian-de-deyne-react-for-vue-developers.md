I had the honor to be a guest on [Full Stack Radio](http://www.fullstackradio.com) with Adam Wathan.

We talked about why I prefer React over Vue — which I [wrote about](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/why-i-prefer-react-over-vue) two weeks ago — and how to implement some patterns that Vue provides out of the box but aren't explicitly available in React. Examples include computed properties, events and slots.

Adam's quote:

> In this episode, Adam talks to Sebastian De Deyne about learning React from the perspective of a Vue developer, and how to translate all of the Vue features you're already comfortable with to React code.
