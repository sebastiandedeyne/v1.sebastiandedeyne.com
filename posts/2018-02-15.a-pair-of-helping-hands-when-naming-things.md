title: A pair of helping hands when naming things
---
One of the hardest (and sometimes frustrating) tasks in a programmer's day-to-day workload is naming things. When I have a hard time finding that perfect word, I generally wind up in one of two situations:

- I have a plausible name in mind, but I'm _not entirely satisfied_ with it
- I have _no idea_ what I could possibly name it

Luckily, there are tools out there that can be of help.

## "Surely there's a better word for this"

This often occurs when the name I have in mind is a bit too generic, or when it just doesn't _feel_ right.

Synonyms are great for when the word you're looking at is close-but-not-perfect.
[Thesaurus.com](http://www.thesaurus.com/) is a great place to browse synonyms. You can keep clicking through until you've found exactly what you're looking for.

## "I have a complete lack of inspiration today"

Sometimes I'm completely stumped. I know the _context_ of the word I'm looking for, but I can't think of anything that resembles it. [Word Associations Network](https://wordassociations.net) can help here. The results here are a lot more broad than the ones on Thesaurus.

## Alfred

I ofter refer to these services when coding or writing, so I made an [Alfred workflow](https://github.com/sebastiandedeyne/naming-things-alfred-workflow) that lets me seamlessly search for the perfect word.

The workflow is available on GitHub and adds two keywords to search for synonyms and associations: `syn` and `assoc`.

Typing `syn dog` in Alfred will direct me to a list of "dog" synonyms like "pup", "mutt" or "tail-wagger". `assoc dog` will provide a broader search, like "kennel", "handler" and "cat".

## Keep it simple

Like with code, don't try to be _too_ smart all the time. If what you're building already exists elsewhere, you might not need to come up with a name on your own. There might be an often used term for a specific concept. Look for alternative implementations of the same conceptâ€”even (especially!) in other programming languages. Maybe you can borrow something.

This post wouldn't be complete without Phil Karlton's renowned quote, so I'll just leave this here.
